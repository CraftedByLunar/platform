# Welcome To Lunar!

Lunar is an open-source component library designed for modern web development, providing production-ready components with comprehensive implementation guides. The platform serves developers at all experience levels, from those building their first interfaces to teams shipping enterprise applications.

---

## Platform Overview

Lunar delivers a curated collection of web components built with contemporary web technologies. Each component includes detailed documentation, implementation examples, and performance considerations to ensure optimal integration into existing projects.

The platform emphasizes **developer autonomy** through open-source licensing, community-driven development, and zero-cost access to all resources and components.

---

## Component Architecture

All Lunar components are constructed using industry-standard libraries and frameworks. The core technology stack includes:

- **GSAP** for high-performance animations and micro-interactions
- **Framer Motion** for React-based declarative animations
- **Lenis** for smooth scroll implementations and scroll-based interactions

This architecture ensures consistent performance, maintainable code, and seamless integration with modern development workflows.

---

## Installation Requirements

### Node.js Projects

Install the core dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install framer-motion gsap lenis
```

---

### HTML/CDN Implementation

For projects using CDN delivery, reference the following resources:

#### GSAP Integration

Access the complete GSAP library and plugins through the official CDN:
https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation/?tab=cdn&module=esm&require=false

Select only the required plugins to optimize bundle size and loading performance.

---

#### Lenis Smooth Scroll

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lenis@1.3.3/dist/lenis.min.js"></script>
```

---

#### Framer Motion

Framer Motion is React-specific and not required for vanilla HTML implementations.

---

## Component Categories

Lunar components span multiple interface categories:

- **Navigation Systems**: Bottom navigation, sidebar menus, breadcrumb components
- **Interactive Elements**: Animated buttons, form controls, hover effects
- **Layout Components**: Grid systems, card layouts, responsive containers
- **Animation Utilities**: Scroll-triggered animations, page transitions, micro-interactions

---

## Implementation Standards

Each component includes:

- **Production-ready code** with performance optimizations
- **Responsive design patterns** for cross-device compatibility
- **Accessibility considerations** following WCAG guidelines
- **Browser compatibility** information and fallback strategies
- **Customization examples** for brand integration

---

## Development Philosophy

Lunar prioritizes **practical implementation** over theoretical concepts. All components are tested in real-world scenarios and optimized for production environments. The documentation focuses on implementation mechanics, performance implications, and integration strategies rather than basic web development concepts.

---

## Community Contribution

As an open-source platform, Lunar encourages community participation through component submissions, documentation improvements, and issue reporting. The collaborative development model ensures components remain current with evolving web standards and development practices.
