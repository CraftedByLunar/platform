Lunar is a developer-first platform offering modern, animated UI components with copy-paste code and clear tutorials, no login or friction required. Built with React, Vite, and GSAP, it's designed to help developers build professional, high-performance sites faster.

Each component is handcrafted and explained in detail so you can drop it into your project and understand how it works. Learn by doing, whether you're building client projects, startup sites, portfolios, or anything in between.

Lunar is open-source and free to use for all core features. Some advanced features may require a premium plan in the future.
